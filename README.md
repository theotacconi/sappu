The aim of building Sappu was to get a deeper understanding of physical hardware. 

Many emulators simulate behavior (e.g., `acc += val`). 
Sappu simulates the **electricity**. The entire CPU is built on top of just two C primitives: `NAND` and `NOT`. 
From there, I implemented gates, then components, then the bus...

The choice of C was purely for its simplicity and semantic flexibility.

## Architecture

The architecture is based on the SAP-1 (Simple As Possible) computer.

### Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PC** | Program Counter - holds address of next instruction |
| **MAR** | Memory Address Register - selects RAM address |
| **RAM** | 8 bytes of memory (addresses 0-7) |
| **IR** | Instruction Register - holds current instruction |
| **ACC** | Accumulator - main working register |
| **B** | B Register - second operand for ALU |
| **ALU** | Arithmetic Logic Unit - performs add/subtract |
| **OUT** | Output Register - displays results |
| **Control Unit** | Generates control signals based on instruction |

## Instruction Set

| Mnemonic | Opcode | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `LDA` | `0000` | `LDA addr` | Load value from RAM[addr] into Accumulator |
| `ADD` | `0001` | `ADD addr` | Add RAM[addr] to Accumulator |
| `SUB` | `0010` | `SUB addr` | Subtract RAM[addr] from Accumulator |
| `OUT` | `1110` | `OUT` | Output Accumulator value to display |
| `HLT` | `1111` | `HLT` | Halt the CPU |

## Writing Programs

RAM is **8 bytes** (addresses 0-7). Each line in your assembly file corresponds to a RAM address. Use `DAT` to store data values.

```asm
# Address | Instruction
# --------|------------
# 0       | LDA 5       # Load 10 from address 5
# 1       | ADD 6       # Add 4 from address 6
# 2       | OUT         # Output result (14)
# 3       | HLT         # Stop
# 4       |             # Unused padding
# 5       | DAT 10      # First number (10)
# 6       | DAT 4       # Second number (4)

```

## Building & Running

```bash
# Build
make

# Quick start (auto-run mode)
./sap src/program.asm -auto

# Manual stepping (useful for debugging)
./assembler src/program.asm
./run ram.bin

```

## Project Structure

I've organized the code to separate the abstraction layers:

```
src/
├── gates.c       # The physics: AND, OR, NOT, XOR implementation
├── alu.c         # The math: Adder/Subtractor built from gates
├── memory.c      # The storage: Flip-flops and Registers
├── control.c     # The brain: Signal generation
├── computer.c    # The motherboard: Wiring it all together
└── assembler.c   # The tool: Assembly to binary converter

```

## Microcode (Fetch-Execute Cycle)

### Fetch Phase

| Step | Signals | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | `CO MI` | PC → Bus → MAR |
| T2 | `RO II` | RAM[MAR] → Bus → IR |
| T3 | `CE` | PC++ |

### Execute Phase (Example: ADD)

| Step | Signals | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T4 | `IO MI` | IR[3:0] → Bus → MAR |
| T5 | `RO BI` | RAM[MAR] → Bus → B |
| T6 | `EO AI` | ALU(ACC+B) → Bus → ACC |

## Control Signals Reference

| Signal | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CO` | Counter Out | PC outputs to bus |
| `CE` | Counter Enable | Increment PC |
| `MI` | MAR In | Load MAR from bus |
| `RO` | RAM Out | RAM outputs to bus |
| `II` | IR In | Load IR from bus |
| `IO` | IR Out | IR operand to bus |
| `AI` | Accumulator In | Load ACC from bus |
| `AO` | Accumulator Out | ACC outputs to bus |
| `BI` | B Register In | Load B from bus |
| `EO` | ALU Out | ALU outputs to bus |
| `SU` | Subtract | ALU subtract mode |
| `OI` | Output In | Load OUT from bus |
| `HLT` | Halt | Stop execution |
